# Jumpcloud Vue UI Assessment

This will be repository for my **Jumpcloud UI Engineer Assignment**. Many firsts will be tackled during this assessment, being that I am out of practice with modern JS Frameworks, having not worked with them since 2017. I come from a background of jQuery, ES6, PHP, and Ruby / RoR. I've done light reading on Vue.js and taken some rudimentary courses in React, but nothing substantial beyond this which isn't horribly out-of-date. I don't share this to pre-emptively set expectations at a low point, but I do expect to make "cute" mistakes, often seen with first-time use of new frameworks. Either way, I expect this will be fun.

I will be using [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) since, on the surface, it seems like React with less steps.
