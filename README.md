# Jumpcloud Vue UI Assessment

This will be repository for my **Jumpcloud UI Engineer Assignment**. Many firsts will be tackled during this assessment, being that I am out of practice with modern JS Frameworks, having not worked with them since 2017. I come from a background of jQuery, ES6, PHP, and Ruby / RoR. I've done light reading on Vue.js and taken some rudimentary courses in React, but my understanding of both is unsubstantial beyond which is horribly out-of-date. I don't share this to pre-emptively set expectations at a low point, but I do expect to make "cute" mistakes, often seen with first-time use of new frameworks. Either way, I expect this will be fun.

I will be using [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) since, on the surface, it seems like React with less steps. I enjoy how maleable it is and what that means towards making smaller components for a project in isolated areas, whereas React is a one-stop-shop; you use React, or you don't ( unless you use Preact ). I'm coupling it with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for quick access to Google's fantastic Material Design philosophy, along with various other plugins enumerated by the following commands in Git Bash:

```
npm i --save-dev --no-optional vuetify-loader vue-cli-plugin-vuetify sass node-sass sass-loader 

npm i --no-optional --save vuetify vue-router roboto-fontface @mdi/font
``` 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**What you will *not* find:**
* A perfect UI
* A fully functional UI
* The most elegant code

**What you *will* find:**
* Detailed commit notes
* Branch management to prototype ideas before merging into main
* The efforts of a man who knew nothing of Vue prior to this project
