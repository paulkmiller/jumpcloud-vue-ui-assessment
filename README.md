# Jumpcloud Vue UI Assessment

This will be repository for my **Jumpcloud UI Engineer Assignment**. Many firsts will be tackled during this assessment, being that I am out of practice with modern JS Frameworks, having not worked with them since 2017. I come from a background of jQuery, ES6, PHP, and Ruby / RoR. I've done light reading on Vue.js and taken some rudimentary courses in React, but nothing substantial beyond this which isn't horribly out-of-date. I don't share this to pre-emptively set expectations at a low point, but I do expect to make "cute" mistakes, often seen with first-time use of new frameworks. Either way, I expect this will be fun.

I will be using [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) since, on the surface, it seems like React with less steps. I enjoy how maleable it is and what that means towards making smaller components for a project in isolated components, whereas React is a one-stop-shop; you use React, or you don't ( unless you use Preact ). I'm coupling it with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for quick access to Google's fantastic Material Design philosophy, along with various other plugins enumerated by the following commands in Git Bash:


```
npm i --save-dev --no-optional vuetify-loader vue-cli-plugin-vuetify sass node-sass sass-loader 

npm i --no-optional --save vuetify vue-router roboto-fontface @mdi/font
``` 


### **To run the project, clone the repo, navgigate to `pkm-ui-assignment` and run `npm install`. Once the installation has finished, run `npm run serve` to get things going.**
--------------

**What you will *not* find:**
* A perfect UI
* A fully functional UI
* The most elegant code

**What you *will* find:**
* Detailed commit notes
* Branch management to prototype ideas before merging into main
* The efforts of a man who knew nothing of Vue prior to this assignment other than its name and its mild relation to React


Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I hope this is enough to continue our conversation. This assessment, if anything, has taught me that I quite like Vue, and will be cloning this assignment to continue on my own time. You will be able to find the project in my Github repo if you're intereted in my progress.
